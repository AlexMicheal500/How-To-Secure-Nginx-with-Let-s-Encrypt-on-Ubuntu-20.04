To solve this run the following commands:
sudo lsof -i:80
Try to stop the process which are using the port 80 using:

sudo fuser -k 80/tcp
sudo systemctl restart nginx

The above should work

But if not do the below:
In some cases it may be some issues in the configuration file.

You can use nginx -t -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf command to find any miss-configuration.

In some cases this error is caused by a default Nginx site already on port 80. Removing default config works if you don't need a default one!

sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sudo service nginx restart
